Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?
This hotel booking dataset can help us to explore those questions!
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.
All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

SUGGESTIONS

~During Q3 Hotels should arrange for a doctor and baby care items for better service.
~In Q2 and Q3 the bookings are the most,therefore staff should be in full strength in these quarters.
~Hotels can put forward some discount offers in Q1 and Q4 as Bookings rate is less.
~In Q3 hotels can hire part time or contract based staff as the rush is more in this quarter.
~Hotels can promote their business online via social media channels and hiring influencers as most of the Bookings are coming from online portals.
~Repeated guests should be given a priority pass or made the member of some of priority group with perks , to retain them. Since they are mostly in Q1 which is winters , they can be given complementary hot drinks.
~City Hotel should give concessions for people staying for more than 6 days.
~Resort hotels can give complimentary gift and services (like free cabs,etc) for boosting the short stays.
